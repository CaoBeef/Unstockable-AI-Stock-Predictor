# Unstockable-AI-Stock-Predictor
Hello there weary traveler!

I see you have stumbled upon this humble repository made by @CaoBeef. At this point in the river of life, I'm still in high school and not super experienced in the world of artificial intelligence.
However, that is not stopping me from making my own stock market AI to help me make it big as an investor and hopefully never work again in my life. Well, that is the goal and I'm documenting what I will learn in this personal project.
Let's see how far I can get before November hits and I have to submit my college apps!

# Introduction
I began by researching all available information online about past attempts people have made on a stock market AI. What did other researchers and tech enthusiasts try that I could build off of.
